  Create a React app containing Users widget. It should have two states:
 <p> 
1.	First state shows the users list. By default it shows three items. If there are more than three it shows a “View all” button. Which expands the rest of the list when clicked on it. Each item has an avatar, short user information and a “View” button. Design example:

<p>
  2.	Second state shows full user information after clicking on “View” button. It has a “Close” button to go back to the Users list. Button “Send message” does nothing. Design example:
